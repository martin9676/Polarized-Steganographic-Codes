%   *Brief:         Binary steganographic coding example with Polarized 
%                   Steganographic Codes (PSC) which is compiled as a MATLAB MEX function. 
%   *Author:        Martin
%   *Function 1:    bpsc_embed
%   *Param:         [in]    <cover>             The array of cover, storage as int32, must be a 1*N row vector
%                   [in]    <costs>             The modification costs of cover, storage as signgle, must be a 1*N of row vector
%                   [in]    <message>           The array of message, storage as uint8, must be a 1*M of row vector
%                   [in]    <list_size>         Optional, the list size of the encoder, the default value is 8
%                   [in]    <verbose>           Optional, whether to display the steganographic coding information in detail or not, default is false
%   *Return:        [out]   <distortion>        The total embedding distortion
%                   [out]   <stego>             The array of stego, storage as int32
%                   [out]   <n_msg_bits>        The total number of embedded message bits M
%   *Function 2:    bpsc_extract
%   *Param:         [in]    <stego>             The array of stego, storage as int32, must be a 1*N row vector
%                   [in]    <n_msg_bits>        The total number of embedded message bits M
%   *Return:        [out]   <ext_msg>           The array of the extracted message, storage as uint8, which is a 1*M row vector
%   *Note:          Thanks for the Phil Salleeâ€™s MATLAB JPEG Toolbox that recompiled by the 
%                   Digital Data Embedding Laboratory at Binghamton University in New York, 
%                   which is downloaded at http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/jpeg_toolbox.zip.
%                   Thanks for the MATLAB re-implementation of UERD distortion function by Mach,
