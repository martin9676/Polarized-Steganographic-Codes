## Report for performance comparison of STC and SPSC

**Participant's Title and Name**: *Title and name (Preferable but optional)*  
**Participant's Affiliation**: *Affiliation (Preferable but optional)*  

**Distortion/Profile**: *You are expected to input the type of cover media and describe adopted steganographic distortion functions here, such as IMAGE/J-UNIWARD.*  
**Steganalytic tools**: *Here, the name of tools used for steganalysis is expected, e.g., DCTR.*  
**Source of the cover**: *The source of cover is required here, e.g., 10,000 BOSSBase in grayscale, size 512\*512.*  
**Evaluation platform**: *Detailed information on the device platform for your evaluation. At least the version of the operating system and CPU model is required.*  

#### The error rate (in %) of the steganalytic tools

 - **Group 1**: *e.g., Image steganography on BOSSBase with J-UNIWARD distortion. (error rate/avg. running time in sec.)*

**Brief conclusion**: *Briefly describe the results of the evaluation conducted, e.g., In this evaluation, is clear that SPSC has a prior anti-detection performance than the STC since the detection error rate of which is higher.*
